<b>Remote temperature Sensor project</b>

<b>Goal:</b> Develop a prototype of a "Nest"-like temperature sensor. The physical device consists of Wi-Fi modules connected to a temperature sensor. Temperature data collected by the device is pushed to MongoDB. The webapp allows authenticated users to view graphs generated using the collected data.
